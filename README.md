# Food Wise

Food Wise is an iOS application focused on reducing food waste by connecting people with surplus food to those who can benefit from it—before it goes to waste. The platform enables users to purchase food nearing its expiration date or with minor imperfections, still safe and suitable for consumption, at discounted prices from local merchants and retailers.

In addition to buying food, users can also share excess or compostable food within their community to minimize household waste. The app supports three types of users:

- Customers, who browse, order, or request shared food;

- Merchants, such as local eateries and supermarkets offering surplus food at reduced prices to avoid losses;

- Couriers, who deliver food directly to customers’ doorsteps or facilitate pickups.

By bridging the gap between surplus and need, Food Wise offers a practical, community-driven solution to food waste.
